        "   Word embedding models such as GloVe attempt to learn a vector space where semantically similar words are clustered close together. However, they have been shown to learn problematic associations, e.g. by embedding \"man\" more closely to \"doctor\" than \"woman\" (and vice versa for \"nurse\"). To detect such biases in word embeddings, [\"Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases\"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230) introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). The WEAT test measures whether two _target_ word sets (e.g., {programmer, engineer, scientist, ...} and {nurse, teacher, librarian, ...}) have the same relative association to two _attribute_ word sets (e.g., man, male, ... and woman, female ...).\n",

Because the test statistic is still dependent on the similarity between words and attributes, changing the word embeddings allows for the relative association between two different sets of target words to be changed. This is significant for the following reason: However, it is essential to keep in mind that these alterations do not always correspond with human biases, which may lead to assessments that are erroneous or unfair**.**"
